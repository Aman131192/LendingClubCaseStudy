## Introduction
The case study's objective is to demonstrate the practical application of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in a real business context. Alongside implementing learned EDA techniques, participants will gain insight into risk analytics within the banking and financial services sector. The study emphasizes understanding how data is leveraged to mitigate the risk of financial loss when lending to customers. Overall, it aims to provide a hands-on experience in using EDA for effective risk management in a business setting.

## Business Understanding
In a consumer finance company specializing in lending to urban customers, the decision-making process for loan approval involves managing two types of risks:

- Risk of Lost Business: If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, rejecting the application results in a missed business opportunity for the company. This risk involves potential loss of revenue and customer engagement.
- Risk of Default: On the other hand, if the applicant is not likely to repay the loan and is prone to default, approving the loan poses a financial risk for the company. This risk involves potential losses due to non-repayment by the borrower.

Balancing these two risks is crucial for the company to make sound lending decisions, ensuring both business growth and financial stability. Effective risk assessment and analysis of applicant profiles are essential components of this decision-making process.

## Objective
The company, identified as the largest online loan marketplace, offers personal loans, business loans, and medical procedure financing through a user-friendly online platform with lower interest rates. However, similar to other lending companies, dealing with loans to "risky" applicants poses a significant financial risk, termed as credit loss. Credit loss refers to the money lost when borrowers default on their payments. In this context, customers labeled as 'charged-off' are considered defaulters.

The case study's primary objective is to employ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify risky loan applicants. By understanding the driving factors or variables strongly indicative of loan default, the company aims to reduce credit loss. This knowledge can be utilized for portfolio management and risk assessment, enabling more informed decision-making in the lending process.
